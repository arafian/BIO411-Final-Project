# BIO441-Final-Project
This tool utilizes the [Resistance Genome Identifier (RGI)](https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi) tool within the Comprehenseive Antibiotic Resistance Database to find expressed antibiotic resistance genes from transcriptomic data. These genes are then analyzed for differential expression using the [Rockhopper](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~btjaden/Rockhopper/) tool.
